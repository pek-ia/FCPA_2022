# Ford C Programming Academy 2022

## Welcome to our C Academy!
We are going swimming in the big sea of C, so pack your snacks and sunscreen - it's going to be immersive!  We will cover a lot of material, some conceptual and some purely technical.  All of this will be *practical*, because it will help you become a good C programmer.
I'll be updating this repository before and during class, so check back periodically!

## Who said that?

C17/C18 pre-ballot working spec for free [here](https://files.lhmouse.com/standards/ISO%20C%20N2176.pdf)


### Online sources:

[https://cppreference.com](https://cppreference.com)

We will use this as a primary source for information during the class.  Currently, the best online reference for the C/C++ language and standard libraries.  Maintained by coders for coders.

[https://isocpp.org](https://isocpp.org)

The Standard C++ Foundation website disseminates up-to-date information about standard C++ on all platforms. Although our class is about C, not C++, you will find the two are closely related.  The Foundation hosts excellent FAQs and Guidelines authored by Bjarne Stroustrup, Herb Sutter, and other top experts.
 
[https://godbolt.org/](https://godbolt.org)

Compiler Explorer, invaluable for starting to understand what the compiler is doing, for whoever wants to take the next step.  Just generally really cool.  

[https://stackoverflow.com/questions](https://stackoverflow.com/questions)

Opinions are banned here, so opinions naturally reign supreme.  Chances are good that your question will get some answer before the mods harsh your mellow.
